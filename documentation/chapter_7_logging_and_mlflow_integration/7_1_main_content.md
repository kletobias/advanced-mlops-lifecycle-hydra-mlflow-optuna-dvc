## 7. Logging and MLflow Integration

- **Centralized Logging**: “configs/logging/default.yaml” sets the format and level. Show how each step logs to a unique file so you can quickly debug transformations or model training.
- **MLflow**: “configs/ml_experiments/base.yaml” centralizes experiment output directories, artifact paths, etc. Emphasize how all experiments get versioned + tracked with minimal code changes.
