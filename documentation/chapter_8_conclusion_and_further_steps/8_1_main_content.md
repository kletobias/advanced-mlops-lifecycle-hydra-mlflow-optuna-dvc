## 8. Conclusion and Further Steps

Finish your documentation with:
1. A short recap: how Hydra + separate config groups + DVC + modular code all work together.
2. Potential expansions, e.g. “We could add Docker or more CI/CD for fully automated pipelines,” or “We might add pre-commit hooks to lint these configs.”

You can also embed links to any Jupyter notebooks or final dashboards that interpret results, so prospective employers can see both the engineering and the analytics side.
