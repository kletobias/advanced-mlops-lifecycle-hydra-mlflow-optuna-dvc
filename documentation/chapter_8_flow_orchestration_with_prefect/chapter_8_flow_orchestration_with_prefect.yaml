  content_section:
  - "### 8.1 Why Use Prefect for Orchestration?\n\n- **Higher-Level Pipeline Control**\
    \  \n  Prefect wraps your data pipeline steps in tasks and flows, providing easier\
    \ concurrency, retries, and centralized logging. This is especially useful when\
    \ you have multiple pipeline triggers or want to schedule jobs more flexibly than\
    \ with basic shell scripts.\n\n- **Modular, Composable Tasks**  \n  Steps like\
    \ `ensure_dvc_is_clean()`, `generate_dvc_yaml()`, and `run_dvc_repro()` each become\
    \ a dedicated Prefect task. Prefect then manages dependencies between tasks, handles\
    \ exceptions, and logs results. You can mix these tasks with other pipelines or\
    \ cloud-based orchestrations.\n\n- **Integration With Hydra + DVC**  \n  Prefect\
    \ doesn’t replace Hydra or DVC; it wraps them. Hydra still manages your configuration\
    \ structure, while DVC handles data versioning. Prefect’s role is orchestrating\
    \ the entire end-to-end flow, ensuring each stage runs in a controlled order with\
    \ proper logging."

  section_name: How the Flow Works
  content_section:
  - "### 8.2 Orchestration Flow Explained\n\n1. **Tasks vs. Flow**  \n   In `orchestrate_dvc_flow.py`,\
    \ each function—like `generate_dvc_yaml`—is annotated with `@task`. Prefect uses\
    \ these to build a graph of how your pipeline executes. The `@flow` decorator\
    \ then defines the higher-level sequence of tasks as one orchestrated run.\n\n\
    2. **Setting Environment Variables**  \n   The `set_environment_vars()` task sets\
    \ `HYDRA_FULL_ERROR` and `OC_CAUSE` so you get full tracebacks if something goes\
    \ wrong, making debugging easier.\n\n3. **Ensure Clean DVC State**  \n   The `ensure_dvc_is_clean()`\
    \ task checks for uncommitted DVC changes in `git status`. If it finds any, it\
    \ raises an exception to prevent partial commits or inconsistent states.\n\n4.\
    \ **Generating the DVC YAML File**  \n   - If `skip_generation` is `false`, we\
    \ call `generate_dvc_yaml(...)`.  \n   - This uses the Hydra config’s `stages_list`\
    \ and a Jinja2 template to build the `dvc.yaml` automatically.  \n   - If the\
    \ new file differs from the old one and `allow_dvc_changes` is `false`, it reverts\
    \ changes for safety. Otherwise, it accepts them.\n\n5. **Running `dvc repro`**\
    \  \n   Once DVC is clean and the YAML file is up to date, `run_dvc_repro()` triggers\
    \ the pipeline. You can force a re-run of all stages with `--force`, or only re-run\
    \ a subset of stages (e.g., `v10_lag_columns`).\n\n6. **Final Execution**  \n\
    \   The entire process is contained in `dvc_flow(...)`. At the very end, logs\
    \ are saved to a file specified by your Hydra config, and you’ll see a summary\
    \ in the console. This modular design means you can schedule this flow in Prefect\
    \ Cloud or run it locally with the same code."

  section_name: Why This Matters
  content_section:
  - "### 8.3 Why This Matters for MLOps\n\n- **Consistency**  \n  Every run starts\
    \ by validating DVC cleanliness and regenerating the pipeline if needed. This\
    \ eliminates “accidental stale pipelines” where you forget to update `dvc.yaml`.\n\
    \n- **Traceability**  \n  Prefect logs each task’s start/end, enabling you to\
    \ see where failures occur. Combined with Hydra’s structured configs and DVC’s\
    \ data versioning, you get a full audit trail of code, data, and pipeline changes.\n\
    \n- **Scalability**  \n  For larger teams or more complex pipelines, Prefect’s\
    \ concurrency, scheduling, and cloud-based run management keep things organized.\
    \ You can extend the flow with additional tasks (e.g., model evaluation, MLflow\
    \ artifact checks) without rewriting your entire pipeline.\n\nBy orchestrating\
    \ the entire DVC pipeline with Prefect, you gain a robust control plane for your\
    \ transformations. Hydra ensures configs remain DRY, DVC tracks data lineage,\
    \ and Prefect coordinates execution. This layered approach is a hallmark of production-grade\
    \ MLOps solutions."
