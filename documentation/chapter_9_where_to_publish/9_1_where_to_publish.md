## 9. Where to Publish This Documentation

- **Portfolio Website**: Create a dedicated “Project: Medical DRG in NY” page with sections or an accordion menu for each piece. Link from your main portfolio.
- **LinkedIn Articles**: Post shorter, more high-level or conceptual pieces. Emphasize your design thinking, how you overcame potential pitfalls, and how you integrated Hydra + DVC.
- **GitHub Wiki or Repository README**: Provide a quick reference so recruiters or collaborators can see how to run the pipeline.
